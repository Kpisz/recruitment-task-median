# recruitment-task-median
This project is a solution to a recruitment task that involves calculating the median of expenses up to (and including) the first Sunday of each month, based on example data provided. The solution is extended to support testing with randomly generated data for any chosen year, making it versatile and reusable.

Project Title:
First Sunday Median Solver

Project Description:
This project is a solution to a recruitment task that involves calculating the median of expenses up to (and including) the first Sunday of each month, based on example data provided. The solution is extended to support testing with randomly generated data for any chosen year, making it versatile and reusable.

Two calculation methods are implemented:

Unoptimized (solution1): Traditional approach using sorting.
Optimized (solution2): Uses the Quick Select algorithm for faster median calculations.
Features:
Calculates medians for example recruitment data.
Supports randomly generated test data for any chosen year.
Includes two calculation methods to compare performance.
Displays execution time for both approaches for performance analysis.
Usage:
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/median-to-first-sunday.git
cd median-to-first-sunday
Open the index.html file in your browser to test the solution.
Use the buttons in the interface to calculate medians for example or random data.
Technologies Used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Quick Select Algorithm
Preview:
The project includes a user-friendly interface for presenting the results in a table with the following details:

Month
Days included (up to the first Sunday)
Median calculated using two approaches
Time taken for each calculation
Example Output:
Month: 2023-01  
Days: 01  
First Sunday: 01  
Median (solution1): 20.55  
Median (solution2): 20.55  
Execution Time:  
  solution1: 5ms  
  solution2: 2ms
